    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <h2>What exactly does this map show?</h2>

    <p>Many aircraft broadcast information about how accurate their navigation
        system, which is almost always GPS, is at any given moment. The GPSJam map
        aggregates that data over 24 hours in time bins it into a hexagonal map.
        Green hexagons show where more than 98% of all aircraft who flew through
        that area reported good navigation accuracy. Yellow hexagons show where
        between 2% and 10% of aircraft reported low navigation accuracy. Red
        hexagons show where more than 10% of aircraft reported low navigation
        accuracy.</p>

    <h2>What is the source of your data?</h2>

    <p>Many aircraft broadcast digital radio messages (ADS-B) that contain
        information about their GPS accuracy. <a href="https://adsbexchange.com">ADS-B
            Exchange</a> is a network of thousands of enthusiasts who receive those
        signals. I use the <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/data/">ADS-B
            Exchange API</a> to collect and process the data and build maps from it.

    <h2>What can cause an aircraft to report low navigation accuracy?</h2>

    <p>Most aircraft with ADS-B are using GPS, and from what I can tell the most
        common reason for aircraft GPS systems to have degraded accuracy is jamming
        by military systems. At least, the vast majority of aircraft that I see with
        bad GPS accuracy are flying near conflict zones where GPS jamming is known
        to occur.</p>

    <p>Other causes of low GPS accuracy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Testing of military jamming systems outside of conflict zones
            (common in the southwestern United States)</li>
        <li>Jamming systems used to protect Russian oligarchs from drones</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are the conflict zones where GPS jamming is regularly observed?</h2>

    <p>The conflict zones where I've most often observed GPS jamming include the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Much of the Middle East, especially including the eastern
            Mediterranean. Iraq, Lebanon, Cyprus, Turkey, Armenia all regularly see
            GPS jamming activity. In North Africa, Libya.</li>
        <li>In Europe, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Kaliningrad, and
            Finland sometimes show presumed jamming activity, depending on how
            active Russia is.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>What time zone are the dates in?</h2>

    <p>UTC.</p>

    <h2>I live in one of the red zones and my GPS was fine?</h2>

    <p>
        The map is based on aircraft reports, and aircraft fly thousands of feet
        above the ground where they have line-of-sight to many more potential
        sources of GPS interference than you do on the ground. The map also
        aggregates a 24 hour period, so it's possible for interference to be
        present for a short time, still affect lots of aircraft and result in a
        region being colored red, but GPS was still fine for most of the day.
